# Description of Project
In this project, I created needle nose pliers that are able to grip and move through-hole resistors. By using a flexible component in the center that connects to four rigid parts, the pliers can pick up different items when force is applied to the handles and then return to their starting position when released.

# Print-In-Place Parts
**Overview**
With print-in-place, the different parts of a product are modeled so that they are ready for use once the print is finished. The biggest benefit to this technique is that production can happen much quicker. Final products can be delivered directly from the 3D printers without any additional processing or assembly time. 
Not only can print-in-place be used to design products with a single material, but it can also be used for multi-material projects. However, when making multi-material parts, the right combination of materials must be utilized. If the product requires multi-material bonding, the following factors must be taken into account: surface energy, chemical composition, shrinkage and cooling rates, and mechanical compatibility. For print-in-place, the combination of materials that work the best are those that have similar properties. If the properties stated above are similar enough, then there will be adequate bonding between and within the different materials.

# About the Design

# Material Choices

* **Phone Holder:** TPU 95A. TPU is very durable and has high UV resistance, making it an optimal choice for a bike mount. Furthermore, a flexible material was required to fit the phone properly while still allowing the phone to slide in and out of the case.
* **Rotating Ball:** TPU 95A. This flexible material allowed the extruded edge of the ball to fit tightly in the tapered part of the Top Handle Clamp. In addition, this meant that the horizontal and vertical orientations could be securely locked into position.
* **Top Handle Clamp:** ABS. A more rigid material was needed for this part to ensure that the rotating ball would stay secured, so ABS was selected. ABS also has high impact resistance, durability, and toughness, which makes it a solid choice in case the bike falls. Finally, it is more UV resistant than PLA, and was a better choice than PLA for the heat set inserts.
* **Bottom Handle Clamp:** PLA. Although ABS might have better material properties, there was quite a bit of warping when printing this part with ABS. Furthermore, this part did not require heat set inserts, so PLA, especially since it is cheaper, was an adequate material.
