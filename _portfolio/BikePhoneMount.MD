# Assembly Instructions

Connect the Rotating Ball to the Phone Holder by placing an M3 screw through the four aligned holes and securing it with an M3 hex nut. Place four M3 heat set inserts in the Top Handle Clamp holes. Use four M3 screws and an allen key to connect the Top Handle Clamp to the Bottom Handle Clamp while securely gripping the handlebars. Place the Rotating Ball component into the Top Handle Clamp. Lock the Rotating Ball into the horizontal or vertical orientation.

# Material Choice

* **Phone Holder:** TPU 95A. TPU is very durable and has high UV resistance, making it an optimal choice for a bike mount. Furthermore, a flexible material was required to fit the phone properly while still allowing the phone to slide in and out of the case.
* **Rotating Ball:** TPU 95A. This flexible material allowed the extruded edge of the ball to fit tightly in the tapered part of the Top Handle Clamp. In addition, this meant that the horizontal and vertical orientations could be securely locked into position.
* **Top Handle Clamp:** ABS. A more rigid material was needed for this part to ensure that the rotating ball would stay secured, so ABS was selected. ABS also has high impact resistance, durability, and toughness, which makes it a solid choice in case the bike falls. Finally, it is more UV resistant than PLA, and was a better choice than PLA for the heat set inserts.
* **Bottom Handle Clamp:** PLA. Although ABS might have better material properties, there was quite a bit of warping when printing this part with ABS. Furthermore, this part did not require heat set inserts, so PLA, especially since it is cheaper, was an adequate material. 

# Rationale Behind the Design

* The Phone Holder component was mainly made as a phone case so that the phone would be thoroughly secured. This ensured that there would be no problems with the phone falling out of the holder as well as maintained access to all of the phoneâ€™s functions. This design also allowed the phone to be placed quickly into the mount without any additional tools.
* An additional part was added to the phone case to allow for an easy connection with the Rotating Ball component.
* The Rotating Ball was made to allow for effective switching between vertical and horizontal orientations.
* A tapered extrusion was made in the Top Handle Clamp so that the Rotating Ball would fit tightly and lock into position.
* Heat set inserts were inserted into the Top Handle Clamp so that screws could go through the Bottom Handle Clamp and tighten onto the Top Handle Clamp while gripping the handlebars. This allowed for a stable grip that did not damage the bike in any way.
* Four places for screws were added. These four contact points ensured that the handle clamp would solidly grip the handlebars and maintain its position.
