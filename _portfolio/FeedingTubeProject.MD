* **Challenge:** A young boy, named Hugh, with clubbed arms and a feeding tube did not have the strength or dexterity to feed himself independently. 
* **2 Main Designs** 
  *  Air Pump: Created a device where Hugh can press down and inflate an air pump with his elbow, which then leads his food to be pushed out of a bag and into his feeding tube.
  *  Manual Syringe Pump: Designed a manual syringe pump that can fit a 300 mL syringe and has a specialized handle that he is able to turn to drive the motion of the syringe.
* **Next Steps** 
  * While Hugh was able to feed himself using both devices, my team and I want to continue to improve them in order to make them as easy and effective for Hugh to use as possible. For the Air Pump, we found that there was always a layer of residue left over, despite various different versions and prototypes built to try to solve this problem. Therefore, we have decided to focus on the manual syringe pump. We are working to create a handle that is easier to turn, specifically with more viscous materials.
  * Another young boy, named Jameson, also came to us with similar issues concerning his feeding tube. Thus, we have expanded the project and are working to build another manual syringe pump that addresses his specific challenges and needs.
