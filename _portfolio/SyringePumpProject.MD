# Features

* **Interchangeable Syringe Sizes** This syrnge pump accomodates two diffferent syringe sizes, a 5 mL syringe and a 20 mL syringe. There is a small piece that can easily be attached in order to stabilize the smaller syringe. There is also a small divet in the plunger holder piece that allows for a snug fit of either syringe.
* **CAD Modeling** Four different parts were designed in Fusion 360 to create an effective and stable syringe pump. Then, a complete syringe pump design was modeled in Fusion 360 to simulate its capabilities and to ensure each parts would fit together properly once 3D printed.
* **Programmming** Pellets are the cheapest form of feedstock for any plastic-based manufacturing process. Save 50-75% of material costs by using pellets instead of spools of filament. Concentrated colorant can be added to the virgin material to achieve any color in the rainbow without requiring large amounts of storage. Recyled material can also be used for sustainable material printing.
